                      "The layout of this store was recently ruined but a re-design.  The staff is friendly.  The lunch bar leaves something to be desired but they do have a decent cheese selection.  The store isles are now very crowded since the redesign and some of the stuff is difficult to find.  It seems like a lot of Kroger stores are getting redesigned and not for the better.",
